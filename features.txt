Features:
- Access to credit for workers. These loans will be underwritten 
by assessing borrowers' paycheck/cashflow not based on credit history.
Here's how we will do it:
    1. Users grant us access to their payroll provider
    2. Credet can then see what their paycheck is
    3. Then using that info, we underwrite loans (75% of their daily wage)


Better credit reporting/scoring
-------------------------------
Our proprietary credit scoring algorithm will focus on these metrics:
- Consistency
- Regularity
- Employment status
- Source of income



- The ability for users to sell their products in the app
by simply creating a dynamic sharable link.
- We then show the products to other users of the app in the
dashboard

Q2. If it's a bank, what would make it better than 
a legacy bank (from experience, finacial benefit and payment POV)?

Q3. If Q2 is held true, what kind of tools need to be built to 
empower our customers to make more money, like what Cosimo de' Medici did?
